# Flow graphs for Python

Record dataflow graphs of Python programs using dynamic program analysis.

The package can be used standalone but is designed primarily to be used in conjunction with our [semantic analyis](https://github.com/IBM/semanticflowgraph) tools. The main use case is analyzing short scripts in data science and scientific computing. This package is not appropriate for analyzing large-scale industrial software.

This is **alpha** software. Contributions are welcome!
